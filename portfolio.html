        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Megaman is stuck in a factory and he must make his way out by beating the monsters that come his way. 
        The scoring system is based off on how long the player is able to survive while also getting hits in on the boss.
        The randomness factor comes from the spawn times of each enemy sprite whether it be the actual enemy or the shots being fired.
        The difficulty change comes from the range of spawn times which is lowered which happens to correlate with the randomness factor.
        The game ends when the player gets hit by either the enemy or pellets for three times, each knocking out a life.</p>
        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <p>We decided to make this game because we believed a fun game was difficult was also maintaining a lot of focus. Our original intent was lots of movement and possibly a bullet hell game.
        The first successful point in the development process of our game was the movement animation which allowed a relatively flowing movement.
        The second successful point in the development process of our game was the actual movement aspect of each sprite.
        The first obstacle in the development process was overcoming the problem where a sprite would take too many lives at once. We overcame this with the idea that is basically invincibility frames after getting hit.
        The second obstacle in the development process was overcoming the problem where the player's bullet would be really glitchy with the direction it was travelling. We overcame this problem by making the variables independent and simpler.
        If there was more time and resources, the many glitches and bugs that can be clearly seen would be fixed. Also there was a lot more in store but the idea was too ambitious for that short of time. Also, some parts like the instructions were somehow deleted and could be added back.</p>
        <h2>Important Algorithm</h2>
        <img src="important alg.JPG" alt="Important Algorithm">
        <p>This is an algorithm because it is a set of rules or steps to complete the task, which happens to be movement. It starts the player hidden in position until the START button is clicked and it will control the player's movement aspect. The left and right movement is self explanatory but the vertical movement utilizes the gravity aspect to allow jumping and falling.</p>
